	abstract = {The atmospheric refraction affects the position of objects in the sky in two ways: a chromatic effect and a field differential effect. The former is about the same in the field and can be, in principle, corrected using an Atmospheric Dispersion Compensator (ADC). The latter is dependent of the field size and cannot be corrected. For spectroscopy in wide fields, both effects have to be carefully considered because they affect the spectrophotometry in terms of signal to noise ratio and spectral distortions. The present study aims to evaluate the atmospheric effects in the case of the VIMOS instrument for the ESO VLT. It is shown that provided a careful operational mode the distortion of spectra can be kept at a level less than 15{\%} with reasonable constraints.},

	abstract = {Current and future imaging surveys will measure cosmic shear with a statistical precision that demands a deeper understanding of potential systematic biases in galaxy shape measurements than has been achieved to date. We investigate the effects of using the point spread function (PSF) measured with stars to determine the shape of a galaxy that has a different spectral energy distribution (SED) than the star. We demonstrate that a wavelength dependent PSF size, for example as may originate from atmospheric seeing or the diffraction limit of the primary aperture, can introduce significant shape measurement biases. This analysis shows that even small wavelength dependencies in the PSF may introduce biases, and hence that achieving the ultimate precision for weak lensing from current and future imaging surveys will require a detailed understanding of the wavelength dependence of the PSF from all sources, including the CCD sensors.},

@article{AlejandroPlazas2012,
	abstract = {The wavelength dependence of atmospheric refraction causes elongation of finite-bandwidth images along the elevation vector, which produces spurious signals in weak gravitational lensing shear measurements unless this atmospheric dispersion is calibrated and removed to high precision. Because astrometric solutions and PSF characteristics are typically calibrated from stellar images, differences between the reference stars' spectra and the galaxies' spectra will leave residual errors in both the astrometric positions (dr) and in the second moment (width) of the wavelength-averaged PSF (dv) for galaxies.We estimate the level of dv that will induce spurious weak lensing signals in PSF-corrected galaxy shapes that exceed the statistical errors of the DES and the LSST cosmic-shear experiments. We also estimate the dr signals that will produce unacceptable spurious distortions after stacking of exposures taken at different airmasses and hour angles. We also calculate the errors in the griz bands, and find that dispersion systematics, uncorrected, are up to 6 and 2 times larger in g and r bands,respectively, than the requirements for the DES error budget, but can be safely ignored in i and z bands. For the LSST requirements, the factors are about 30, 10, and 3 in g, r, and i bands,respectively. We find that a simple correction linear in galaxy color is accurate enough to reduce dispersion shear systematics to insignificant levels in the r band for DES and i band for LSST,but still as much as 5 times than the requirements for LSST r-band observations. More complex corrections will likely be able to reduce the systematic cosmic-shear errors below statistical errors for LSST r band. But g-band effects remain large enough that it seems likely that induced systematics will dominate the statistical errors of both surveys, and cosmic-shear measurements should rely on the redder bands.},

Beyond that it becomes sen- sitive to the values of the parameters used, particularly the pressure, temperature, temperature lapse rate, and wavelength of the light ray.
